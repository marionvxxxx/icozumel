# Cozumel Marketplace - Code Audit Report

## 1. Recent Changes Analysis

Based on the file structure and recent modifications, here are the key areas that have seen significant changes:

### High-Activity Areas:
- **Admin Dashboard Components** (`src/components/dashboard/`)
- **API Routes** (`src/app/api/`)
- **Mobile App Integration** (`apps/mobile/src/`)
- **Database Schema** (`supabase/migrations/`)
- **Configuration Files** (package.json, next.config.js, netlify.toml)

### Potential Risk Areas:
1. **Dependency Conflicts**: React version mismatches causing ERESOLVE errors
2. **Missing Implementations**: Several features referenced but not fully implemented
3. **Configuration Drift**: Multiple config files with inconsistent settings
4. **Import Path Issues**: Broken imports due to file restructuring

## 2. Dependency Audit Results

### Critical Issues Found:
- React version conflicts (19.0.0-rc vs stable 18.x)
- Missing peer dependencies for UI components
- Outdated security-sensitive packages
- Unused dependencies increasing bundle size

### Recommendations:
- Standardize on React 18.3.1 across all packages
- Remove unused dependencies
- Update security-critical packages
- Add proper peer dependency declarations

## 3. Code Quality Issues Identified

### TypeScript Configuration:
- Missing strict type checking in some areas
- Inconsistent type definitions
- Any types used in critical paths

### ESLint/Prettier:
- Inconsistent code formatting
- Missing import sorting rules
- Unused variable warnings

### Performance Concerns:
- Unnecessary re-renders in mobile components
- Missing memoization in expensive operations
- Inefficient data fetching patterns

## 4. Security Concerns

### Authentication & Authorization:
- RLS policies need verification
- API endpoints missing proper validation
- Webhook signature verification needs strengthening

### Data Handling:
- Sensitive data exposure in client-side code
- Missing input sanitization
- Insufficient error handling

## 5. Testing Coverage Gaps

### Missing Tests:
- API route handlers
- Critical business logic
- Error boundary components
- Mobile app core functionality

## 6. Documentation Issues

### Outdated Documentation:
- README files don't match current implementation
- Missing API documentation
- Incomplete setup instructions
- No troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps:
1. Fix dependency conflicts
2. Implement missing features
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Update documentation
5. Strengthen security measures
